    "feedback": " I second that. I just made a suggestion in a YouTube live session by Prashant Sir regarding buying call options instead of just straddle from option chain. And a couple of days later a new version comes with provision to buy call/put straddle to accommodate all types of traders. Just imagine noting the suggestion from hundreds to a few thousand YT live comments and implementing it so fast. And my association with DE is only a couple months old and therefore nobody knew me. As far as free is concerned, my DE products are free due to brokerage adjustment against the purchase. Last FY I paid more brokerage (to another broker) than the combined price of all DE products in just 6 months so at that rate my costs will be recovered in less than 6 months. And even if someone's brokerage is less than that, I am sure you will make much more profit than the software costs. Great tools can't make one a great trader but a good trader can do great things with great tools.",

    "feedback": " I am constantly amazed by @PrashantShah267 sir's leadership. The culture that he has built in definedge is amazing. Big corporates aspire for such culture in their organisation but are not even close. Costumer centricity, Ownership, Bias for action, innovation, active listening are few leadership qualities which are practiced by definedge team day in day out. This is a result of his vision and clarity of thoughts. He is also blessed with the company of like minded people in the leadership team. As a result of this, definedge has earned the trust of all the users. Every user indeed speaks for definedge and recommends it's product to his/her family and friends. After 17 years of experience in big organizations, I can say that @PrashantShah267 is an amazing leader and it is almost impossible for other companies to match the culture at definedge .",

We would be unable to work for a single day if we did not work with this intention. That‚Äôs how we are building Definedge.' this is not true i am one of the examples who has transformed from a loss making to profit making discretionary trader to process driven trader",

I also used to try to code the indicators in excel to understand it's unique,properties,because conviction can not be bought.But the R zone is of next level,no excel or manual intervention is required.",
